= Introduction =

The UML diagram containing the classes and the relashionships between them can be found in /trunk/docs/ in .png format.

= Distribution Namespaces =

 * *Apollo*
Top level namespace: designates the project name. All the classes  hierarchy is contained inside this namespace.

 * *Apollo::Logger*
The classes needed in order to properly distribute the logging facility across multiple objects reside here.

 * *Apollo::Logger::Delegates*
In here the logging functionalities are kept, inside classes which designate the logging destination (ex: stdout, stderr, etc..), i.e. delegates used by the Logger class to direct the messages (or entries) to.

Some delegates need more that to only "direct a message", for example the Db delegates needs proper tables to be initialized, moreover, different DB systems declare their tables in different manners.

 * *Apollo::Logger::Delegates::Db*
The Db delegate holds in this namespace 2 essential objects, each of them being particular to the DB system used:
 # a database handle;
 # an SQL statements container (used for holding SQL statements that differ from system to system);

 * *Apollo::Logger::Delegates::Db::SqlContainer*
As was just mentioned above, this namespace has the role of keeping particular SQL statements inside their container.
